Inventory.

Have to use rock as weapon or throw them.

Have to use candle.

Is there a need for this? The tiles show the faces which are a good reference. which means to see it you need to be able to look at it again, examine.

Hitting 1 loads first usable or weapon. Hitting 2, next, etc.

Mousewheel up/down cycles thru usables/weapons

OR. puzzle 4 just displays the tiles on the side for reference.

Items
- rock, wp
- pipe, wp

No other items....  so picking up a weapon replaces the current one

Switch from candle to weapon.... no need to do this?


Would be cool tho to allow examination of non-usables.
